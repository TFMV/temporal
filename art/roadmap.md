# Roadmap: Evolving Flight Orchestration to Enterprise Grade

## Current State

The current prototype demonstrates the power of combining Temporal's workflow engine with Arrow Flight's zero-copy data movement. However, several critical aspects need to be addressed for enterprise-grade deployment:

1. **Data Durability**: Data is currently managed outside Temporal's workflow state
2. **Error Handling**: Limited error recovery mechanisms
3. **Monitoring**: Basic observability capabilities
4. **Security**: No built-in security controls
5. **Scalability**: Basic scaling mechanisms
6. **ETL Integration**: Limited integration with popular data processing tools

    Metadata      map[string]interface{}
    Timestamp     time.Time
    Version       int
    State         CheckpointState
}

type CheckpointManager interface {
    CreateCheckpoint(ctx context.Context, data arrow.Record) (*Checkpoint, error)
    RestoreCheckpoint(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) (arrow.Record, error)
    ValidateCheckpoint(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) error
    CleanupCheckpoint(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) error
}
```

### Recovery System

```go
type RecoveryManager interface {
    DetectFailure(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) error
    RecoverData(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) error
    VerifyConsistency(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) error
    ReportStatus(ctx context.Context, checkpointID string) error
}

## Wrapping Up

This roadmap sets the stage for transforming my Flight Orchestration prototype into something ready for the enterprise. It's not just about getting bigger—it's about growing smarter. By focusing on durability, security, scalability, and seamless ETL integration, I’ll ensure this system thrives in real-world production, without losing any of its speed or efficiency.

The phased approach I've laid out isn't an accident—it's intentional, careful, and incremental. Each step strengthens what's already working, building stability and performance from a solid foundation upward.
