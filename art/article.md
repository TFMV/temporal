# Scaling Data Pipelines with Temporal and Apache Arrow Flight

## Data Transfer Bottlenecks

> I believe, deeply, that if we can make data movement instantaneous, we change the world.

Data moves. Workflows crash. Scaling stalls out - until now.

By combining Temporal for orchestration and Apache Arrow Flight for high-speed data transfer, we built a pipeline that skips the usual slowdowns. No bloated serialization. No wasteful copies. Just raw, efficient movement of data - fast, scalable, and forged for the real fight.

Let's dive in.

## Understanding the Problem

Compute isn't the bottleneck - moving data is.

Pipelines don't stall because CPUs run out of steam. They stall because data gets trapped in transit. The larger the payloads, the worse the turbulence - serialization overhead, memory bloat, latency spikes. It's like trying to push rush-hour traffic through a single-lane tunnel.

The pain points stack up fast:

- Data volumes explode overnight - gigabytes quickly swells into terabytes.
- When workloads scale out, processing jumps across multiple distributed nodes.
- When speed is non-negotiable, sub-second latency isn't a luxury - it's a requirement.
- When resources are stretched thin, memory efficiency makes or breaks performance.

Yet traditional methods keep making the same mistakes:

- Serialization overhead burns CPU cycles on unnecessary format conversions.
- Memory pressure balloons RAM usage with redundant copies.
- Garbage collection storms wreak havoc with excessive allocations and cleanup.
- Network inefficiency chokes bandwidth with bloated data transfers.

We needed a better way - a way to move data without moving it.

## The Solution: Combining Powerful Technologies

To eliminate the bottleneck, we had to rethink how data moves - not just how it's processed. The answer? Temporal and Apache Arrow Flight working in tandem.

### Key Components

- **Temporal** - A distributed workflow engine built for resilience and scalability, ensuring fault-tolerant orchestration.
- **Apache Arrow** - A high-performance, columnar memory format designed for zero-copy processing and vectorized analytics.
- **Arrow Flight** - A transport layer purpose-built for blazing-fast data transfer, eliminating the overhead of traditional serialization.

Individually, these technologies are powerful. Together, they form a workflow-driven pipeline that keeps data in motion - fast, efficient, and built to scale.

## Temporal in 60 Seconds

Temporal is a workflow orchestration engine that solves the hardest parts of distributed systems—durability, visibility, reliability, and scalability.

Durability – Workflows survive crashes, network failures, and even datacenter outages.

Visibility – See exactly what's happening in your workflows in real time.

Reliability – Automatic retries, timeouts, and error handling built-in.

Scalability – Scale from one workflow to millions without changing your code.

Think of Temporal as an operating system for your distributed applications. You write code that describes what should happen, and Temporal ensures it does—even when things go wrong. No more brittle state machines. No more manual retries. No more losing track of execution when services fail.

And you’re not locked into a single language. Temporal supports multiple languages, including Go, Java, TypeScript, and Python, so teams can build workflows using the stack that fits them best.

The magic? Temporal persists the complete state of your workflow, allowing it to resume exactly where it left off after any failure. This makes building resilient distributed applications dramatically simpler—and removes the hidden complexity that derails scalability.

## Apache Arrow Flight in 60 Seconds

Apache Arrow Flight is a high-performance client-server framework for transferring large datasets over network interfaces.

- **Zero-Copy Data Movement** - Data moves without redundant serialization/deserialization.
- **Columnar Format** - Data stays in memory-efficient columnar format during transfer.
- **Streaming Protocol** - Built on gRPC for efficient bi-directional streaming.
- **Vectorized Processing** - Optimized for modern CPU architectures with SIMD instructions.

Traditional data transfer protocols force you to serialize data, send it over the wire, then deserialize it—creating CPU and memory overhead. Flight eliminates this by keeping data in Arrow's columnar format throughout the entire journey.

The result? Transfers that are 5-10x faster than conventional approaches, with dramatically lower memory usage and CPU overhead.

If you're processing massive datasets with traditional serialization methods, you're leaving performance on the table.

Apache Arrow Flight isn't just an upgrade, it's the future.

## The Power of Integration

Temporal excels at orchestrating workflows across distributed systems - managing retries, state, and visibility with ease. But in many data pipelines, large payloads moving between activities become the bottleneck. Serialization overhead creates drag, payload limits introduce constraints, and performance crumbles under the weight of outdated transfer methods.

That's where Apache Arrow Flight takes over. No JSON. No Protobuf. No Avro. Just raw, zero-copy data movement at high speed.

- Temporal keeps workflows running smoothly.
- Arrow Flight keeps data moving without friction.

One manages orchestration. The other eliminates transfer inefficiencies. No bottlenecks. No wasted cycles. Just speed.

## Architecture Overview

Here's how it all fits together:

![Architecture Diagram](temporal.png)

The diagram illustrates how Temporal and Apache Arrow Flight work together to optimize data movement and processing. Each component plays a distinct role in eliminating bottlenecks and ensuring efficient execution.

- **Workflow Orchestration** - A Temporal Server orchestrates the workflow, delegating tasks to multiple Activity Workers. Each worker is responsible for a specific stage of the data pipeline.
- **Data Processing** - The Arrow Flight Server acts as a high-speed intermediary, handling data transfers between activity workers. Workers interact directly with Arrow Flight - pushing, retrieving, and processing data at high speed, without bottlenecks.
- **Zero-Copy Data Transfer** - Data is stored in Apache Arrow's columnar format, allowing vectorized operations that maximize CPU efficiency.
- **Storage & Cleanup** - Once data is processed, it's either persisted in storage or automatically cleaned up based on a time-to-live (TTL) policy.

This architecture keeps Temporal focused on orchestration, Arrow Flight handling data movement, and Arrow's in-memory format maximizing processing efficiency - all working together to create a scalable, high-performance pipeline.

## Implementation Details

### The Arrow Flight Server

At the heart of the system is the Arrow Flight Server. Instead of shuffling payloads through the workflow itself, workers push and pull data efficiently - storing batches when needed, retrieving them on demand.

The server speaks the Arrow Flight protocol, handling DoPut for writing data and DoGet for retrieval. No unnecessary serialization, no redundant copies-just high-speed, zero-copy transfers between processing stages. This keeps workloads lean, memory overhead low, and performance exactly where it needs to be: fast.

### The Temporal Workflow

Rather than dragging massive payloads through the workflow, we pass only lightweight batch IDs. Instead of flooding Temporal with raw data, each activity references a stored batch, retrieving it only when needed.

1. A Generate Batch activity creates data and pushes it to the Arrow Flight Server, returning a batch ID.
2. A Process Batch activity pulls the batch, applies transformations, and pushes the result back - again, passing only an ID.

This keeps the workflow lean, efficient, and scalable. Temporal focuses on orchestration, while Arrow Flight handles the heavy lifting of data movement.

As data scales, the efficiency gap only grows wider. Arrow Flight eliminates serialization overhead, reducing processing time and unlocking true high-speed data movement.

## Wrapping Up

We set out to eliminate the turbulence in data pipelines - to move data, not just process it. Temporal steadies workflows with retries and visibility, Arrow Flight keeps data in motion, and together, they clear the runway for true scaling.

No drag. No delays. Just pure acceleration.
